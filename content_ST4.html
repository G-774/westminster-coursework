    <h1> Overfishing & Its Impact on Marine Life</h1>

    <section>

        <h2>🌊 What is Overfishing?</h2>
        <p>

            Overfishing happens when fish are caught at a faster rate than they can reproduce, leading to declining fish populations. It is one of the biggest threats to marine ecosystems today. With advancements in industrial fishing techniques, massive fishing fleets deplete fish stocks, disrupting the ocean’s natural balance. As fish populations shrink, many marine species that depend on them for food are also affected, creating a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. This not only harms ocean biodiversity but also impacts millions of people who rely on fishing for food and income. Overfishing can lead to the collapse of entire fish populations, making it difficult for them to recover. In some cases, this has forced fishing industries to move to new areas, further straining marine environments. To address this issue, sustainable fishing practices, stricter regulations, and marine conservation efforts are essential in protecting the future of our oceans.

            <li>  Tuna (especially Bluefin tuna) </li>
            <li>  Sharks (for shark fin soup) </li>
            <li>  Shrimp & cod </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> 🌎 Why is Overfishing a Major Problem? </h2>

        <p>

            Overfishing is a major problem because oceans play a crucial role in supporting billions of people by providing food, jobs, and regulating the Earth's climate. However, when fish are caught faster than they can reproduce, global fish stocks decline, disrupting marine ecosystems and threatening the balance of ocean life. This not only affects marine species that depend on fish for survival but also endangers the livelihoods of millions of people who rely on fishing industries. Entire economies, especially in coastal communities, suffer as fish populations dwindle, leading to food shortages and economic instability. Additionally, overfishing can cause long-term damage to marine habitats, making it even harder for fish populations to recover. If left unchecked, overfishing could lead to the collapse of important fisheries, increasing global food insecurity and harming biodiversity. Implementing sustainable fishing practices is essential to preserving ocean health and ensuring future generations can benefit from marine resources.

        <h2> 📜Laws & Global Actions Against Overfishing</h2>
        <p>

            Governments and environmental organizations are taking action against overfishing through regulations, marine protected areas, and public awareness campaigns. Many countries have set fishing quotas and limits to help fish populations recover, while marine protected areas (MPAs) safeguard ecosystems and allow fish stocks to replenish. International agreements, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, help coordinate global efforts. Technological advancements, like satellite monitoring, aid in tracking illegal fishing. Consumer awareness programs also promote sustainable seafood choices. Strengthening laws, enforcing regulations, and encouraging responsible fishing practices are key to restoring marine ecosystems and protecting ocean resources for the future.

        <ul>
            <li> 🐠 Fishing Quotas & Limits : Many countries set strict fishing limits to prevent stock depletion. </li>
            <li> 🌊 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) : Certain parts of the ocean are protected to allow fish populations to recover. </li>
            <li> 📝 International Agreements : The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) regulates fishing rights and protections. </li>

        <h2>📝 Fun Facts About overfishing </h2>
        <p>
            
            Overfishing is a critical issue affecting marine ecosystems around the world. About 90% of global fish stocks are either overfished or fully exploited, which threatens the balance of ocean life. Sharks are especially vulnerable, with an estimated 100 million killed annually for their fins. Industrial fishing practices also contribute to the problem, with fishing nets so large they can hold 13 jumbo jets, causing significant damage to marine habitats and bycatch. However, solutions like Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have proven effective, with some regions seeing a recovery of up to 600% in fish populations.
